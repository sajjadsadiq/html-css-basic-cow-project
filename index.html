        <h2>An Eassy About Cow</h2>
        <p>
          Cattle (Bos taurus) are large, domesticated, bovid ungulates. They are
          prominent modern members of the subfamily Bovinae and the most
          widespread species of the genus Bos. Mature female cattle are referred
          to as cows and mature male cattle are referred to as bulls.
          Colloquially, young female cattle (heifers), young male cattle
          (bullocks), and castrated male cattle (steers) are also referred to as
          "cows".
